<h1>How to Respond</h1>

<p>
At the end of each sentence, you'll be asked to give 2 responses. <strong>First</strong>, you will judge whether or not you found the sentence to be <em>grammatical</em>.

<ul>To respond:
    <li><strong>grammatical</strong>, press the <big><tt>'f'</tt></big> key</li>
    <li><strong>not grammatical</strong>, use the <big><tt>'j'</tt></big> key. 
</ul>

<p>We chose <tt>'f'</tt> and <tt>'j'</tt> so that you can respond quickly by resting both hands on the keyboard, with your left index finger on <tt>'f'</tt> and your right index finger on <tt>'j'</tt>. You may respond with your mouse if you would like as well.
</p>

<p>
<strong>We would like you to respond as quickly as you can</strong>, so <u>go with your gut instinct</u> about the sentence. Don't overthink your response!</p>

<p>To help you go with your first impulse, we're giving you a limit of 2 seconds to respond. Using your hands will allow you to be faster in judging the sentence, so we recommend that.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Then</strong>, after you judge the sentence on grammaticality, you will be asked to rate your confidence in your response using three options. 

<ul>If you are:
    <li><strong>highly confident</strong> in your choice, respond <tt>'Very confident'</tt>.</li>
    <li><strong>a little unsure</strong>, but mostly confident, respond <tt>'Somewhat confident'</tt>.</li>
    <li><strong>not very confident</strong> in your response, respond <tt>'Not very confident'</tt>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You should be sure to use all three confidence levels over the course of the experiment. It's natural for your confidence to vary a lot. Your intuitions won't always be very clear, and that's OK. Plus, we're asking you to give your grammaticality response very quickly.
