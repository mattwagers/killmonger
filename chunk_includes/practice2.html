<b>Instructions</b>
</p>

<p>
At the end of each sentence, you'll be asked to judge whether or not the sentence is 'grammatical,' as well as how confident you are that the sentence is grammatical. To respond that a sentence is grammatical, press the 's' key; to respond that it is not grammatical, use the 'k' key. We chose 's' and 'k' so that you can respond quickly by resting both hands on the keyboard, with your left index finger on 's' and your right index finger on 'k.' You may respond with your mouse if you would like as well.
</p>
<p>
We would like you to respond as quickly as you can, so go with your gut instinct about the sentence, and don't overthink your response! To help you go with your first impulse, we're giving you a limit of 2 seconds to respond. Using your hands will allow you to be faster in judging the sentence, so we recommend that.
</p>
<p>
After you judge the sentence, you will be asked to rate your confidence in your response using three options. If you are highly confident in your choice, you should choose 'Very confident.' If you're a little unsure, but mostly confident, choose 'Somewhat confident.' If you're not very confident in your response, choose 'Not very confident.' 
</p>

<p>
It's natural for your confidence to vary quite a lot from response to response, so you should be sure to use all three confidence levels over the course of the experiment. It's very natural for your confidence to vary a lot; your intuitions won't always be very clear, and that's OK.
