<p>
How do you know whether a sentence is grammatical? By 'grammatical,' we simply mean whether or not you think it sounds like natural English you might imagine a friend or colleague using, or if instead the sentence contains a clear error that you don't think any English speaker would make. An example of an ungrammatical sentence in English is "these one girl became unhappy", because "these" can't be used to introduce "one girl;" instead, "this one girl became unhappy" would be the way most English speakers would form that sentence.

<p>
We are not interested in whether an English professor would think the sentence is a good one or not. We are more interested in how native English speakers speak in day-to-day conversation. 
</p>

<p>

You'll find that you have a strong, natural intuition about whether a sentence sounds OK or not, and we just want you to report that 'gut feeling' without overthinking it. 
</p>

<p>
In this experiment, there are many different ways in which a sentence may be grammatical or ungrammatical. In addition, there are no right or wrong answers; many speakers have different intuitions about whether a sentence sounds right or wrong, and that's perfectly natural. Just pay close attention throughout the experiment, and use your gut instincts.
