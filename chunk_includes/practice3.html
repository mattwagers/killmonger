<h1>How to Judge 'Grammaticality'</h1>

<dl>How do you know whether a sentence is grammatical?
    <dt><em>grammatical</em></dt> 
    <dd>a sentence that sounds like natural, acceptable English you might imagine a friend or colleague using.</dd>
    <dt><em>ungrammatical</em></dt>
    <dd>a sentence that contains a clear error that you don't think any English speaker would make</dd>

<p>An example of an ungrammatical sentence in English is <tt>"Which girl did you meet her?"</tt>. <tt>"Which girl did you meet?"</tt> would be the way most English speakers would form that sentence. 
</p>

<p>
In this experiment, <strong>all the sentences will be in the form of questions</strong>, like:
<ul><li><tt>Who thinks she should receive an award?</tt> (<em>grammatical</em>) or 
    <li><tt>Which pop star is everyone talking about who divorced?</tt> (<em>ungrammatical</em>)
</ul>
</p>

<p>We are not interested you asking yourself whether an English teacher or writing instructor would think the sentence is an example of good writing. We are interested in how native English speakers speak in day-to-day conversation. Are these questions that fluent native speakers could use? 
</p>

<p>
You'll find that you have a strong, natural intuition about whether a sentence sounds OK or not, and we just want you to report that 'gut feeling' without overthinking it. 
</p>

<p>
In this experiment, there are many different ways in which a sentence may be grammatical or ungrammatical. In addition, there are no right or wrong answers. Many speakers have different intuitions about whether a sentence sounds right or wrong, and that's perfectly natural. Just pay close attention throughout the experiment, and use your gut instincts.
